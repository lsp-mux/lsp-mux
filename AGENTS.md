# lsp-proxy

A multiplexing LSP proxy. Presents as a single LSP server while
internally managing multiple language servers per file type.

## Problem

Claude Code's LSP plugin system has limitations:

- **One server per file type** — can't run vtsls + ESLint for `.ts` files
- **No inter-server communication** — Volar 3 requires `tsserver/request` /
  `tsserver/response` forwarding between the Vue LS and a TypeScript LS
- **No lifecycle recovery** — a crashed LSP server requires restarting Claude
- **Cache `.lsp.json` args ignored** — Claude reads `command` from local plugin
  cache but fetches `args` from the remote marketplace, so local patches to
  launch arguments have no effect (tested on Claude Code 2.1.83)

## Project Structure

pnpm workspace monorepo:

- **`packages/proxy`** — the multiplexing proxy core. Dependencies:
  `vscode-jsonrpc`, `picomatch`, `valibot`.
- **`packages/registry`** — server config registry. Pre-defined configs
  for common LSP servers (vtsls, eslint). The proxy resolves server names
  from the registry, deep-merges user overrides, and validates npm deps.
- **`packages/claude-code`** — Claude Code editor integration. Provides
  `generate-claude-plugin` bin that produces `.lsp.json` and
  `.claude-plugin/` artifacts from a config directory.
- **`packages/config-default`** — example server configs (vtsls + eslint
  for TS/JS). Depends on the proxy, claude-code, and LSP server packages.
  Users create their own config package with different servers.
- **`packages/vscode-eslint-extracted`** — ESLint language server extracted
  from the VS Code ESLint extension VSIX. Downloads the pre-built server on
  `postinstall`. Needed because `vscode-langservers-extracted` doesn't
  support ESLint 10 flat config.

The proxy accepts `--config-dir` to locate `.lsp-proxy.json` and
`servers/*.json`. The `generate-claude-plugin` bin reads configs from `cwd`
and writes `.lsp.json` / `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` there. Relative paths
in server configs (e.g., `./node_modules/...`) are resolved to absolute
paths at config load time so child servers inherit the workspace cwd.

## Design

A Node.js process that:

- Accepts stdio from any LSP client as a single LSP server
- Spawns and manages child LSP servers
- Routes requests by file type / language ID to the appropriate server(s)
- Merges diagnostics from multiple servers (union of push and pull models)
- Delivers per-server settings and responds to configuration pulls
- Auto-restarts crashed servers transparently
- Watches workspace files and resyncs document state on external changes
- Logs to `<logDir>/<timestamp>.log` with runtime-configurable level

### Architecture

```

    |--- vtsls
    |--- vue-language-server v3  (planned — requires bridging)
    |       |-- tsserver/request --> vtsls  (bridge)
    |       |<- tsserver/response <-- vtsls
    |--- eslint
    '--- css/html
```

### Server Configuration

Each server is defined in its own JSON file in the config package's `servers/`
directory (command, args, languages, transport, settings). The proxy loads
configs from `--config-dir` (or its own package root as fallback).

A separate `.lsp-proxy.json` defines which servers to load:

```jsonc
{
  "servers": ["vtsls", "eslint"],
  // Optional — DEBUG, INFO (default), WARN, ERROR.
  // Change at runtime without restarting (file is watched).
  "logLevel": "INFO",
  // Glob patterns to exclude from workspace file watching.
  // Matches against paths relative to the workspace root.
  // Defaults shown below — override to customize.
  "watcherExclude": [
    "**/node_modules/**",
    "**/.git/**",
    "**/.hg/**",
    "**/.svn/**",
    "**/dist/**"
  ]
}
```

Future config fields (not yet implemented):

```jsonc
{
  "bridges": [{
    "from": "vue-volar",
    "notification": "tsserver/request",
    "to": "vtsls",
    "method": "typescript.tsserverRequest",
    "respond": "tsserver/response"
  }],
  "merge": {
    "diagnostics": "union",
    "completion": "interleave",
    "hover": "concatenate",
    "definition": "union",
    "references": "union",
    "codeAction": "union"
  }
}
```

### Key Decisions

- **Replaces individual plugins** — the proxy is the single LSP plugin
  registered with Claude Code; individual server plugins are not installed
- **JSON-RPC multiplexing** — each child server gets its own stdio pair;
  the proxy demuxes requests and muxes responses
- **File-type routing** — derived from each server's `extensionToLanguage`
  mapping; a file can fan out to multiple servers
- **Response merging** — diagnostics merged via union; other methods routed
  to primary server only (full merging planned for M4)
- **Pull diagnostics** — servers that advertise `diagnosticProvider` are
  proactively queried after document sync events and on
  `workspace/diagnostic/refresh`; results are stored and published via push
- **Settings delivery** — per-server `settings` in server configs are
  pushed via `workspace/didChangeConfiguration` after init and returned
  in response to `workspace/configuration` pulls, with `workspaceFolder`
  injected from the proxy's workspace root
- **Server-to-client request routing** — all server-initiated requests
  are tracked so client responses are delivered back to the originating
  server (not just register/unregister)
- **Notification bridging** — declarative config for forwarding custom
  notifications between servers (planned for M3)
- **Request ID namespacing** — proxy rewrites IDs to avoid collisions
  between servers, maps responses back to the original client ID
- **Lifecycle management** — exponential backoff restart with max retries;
  transparent to the client
- **Document state tracking** — proxy tracks `didOpen`/`didChange`/`didClose`
  and replays current state to servers that restart mid-session
- **URI normalization** — file URIs from clients and servers are
  normalized to standard `file:///` format on ingest. Some LSP
  implementations (e.g., vtsls on Windows) emit non-standard URIs
  with backslashes or missing authority slashes, which breaks
  cross-server features like diagnostics merging and configuration
  resolution. Round-trip through `fileURLToPath`/`pathToFileURL`
  ensures consistent keying across the proxy.
- **Client capability compensation** — during `initialize`, the proxy
  inspects the client's `ClientCapabilities` and compensates for missing
  features. Currently the only compensation is local file watching
  (activated when `workspace.didChangeWatchedFiles.dynamicRegistration`
  is absent or `false`). Clients that support file watching natively
  receive forwarded watcher registrations instead.
- **File watching** (compensation) — when the client lacks native file
  watching support, the proxy watches tracked files with `fs.watch`
  (like VS Code's built-in file watcher). When an external tool (e.g.,
  ESLint `--fix`, `git checkout`) modifies a file, the proxy reads from
  disk, compares with tracked content, and sends `didClose`/`didOpen`
  with fresh content to the relevant child servers.
- **Config/proxy separation** — the proxy package is server-agnostic; which
  servers to run is determined by the config package. Users create their own
  config package with different servers without forking the proxy.
- **Logging** — file-based, not stderr, so logs persist and don't
  interfere with stdio transport. Log directory resolved via
  `--log-dir` CLI flag > `logDir` in `.lsp-proxy.json` >
  platform default (`$XDG_DATA_HOME/lsp-proxy/logs` on Linux/macOS,
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\lsp-proxy\logs` on Windows). Runtime level changes
  via `logLevel` in `.lsp-proxy.json` (file watched). Server
  `window/logMessage` forwarded at appropriate severity.

### Volar 3 Forwarding (Example)

Volar 3 removed `hybridMode` — it always requires a companion TypeScript
server. The `bridges` config will handle this declaratively:

1. Volar sends `tsserver/request` notification: `[requestId, command, args]`
1. Proxy matches the bridge rule, forwards to vtsls
1. Proxy sends `tsserver/response` notification back: `[requestId, body]`

No proxy code changes needed — just config.

### Challenges

- **Response merging complexity** — deduplicating completions, formatting
  concatenated hovers, handling partial timeouts (one server fast, another
  slow). Start with diagnostics-only merging and expand incrementally.
- **Capability negotiation** — the proxy advertises the union of all child
  capabilities but must gracefully handle methods only some servers support
- **Stateful sync** — every child server needs document notifications in
  lockstep; a restarted server must receive the current document state

## Milestones

### M1: Single-server passthrough (done)

Wire up the proxy to manage a single child server (vtsls) with lifecycle
restart. Validates the JSON-RPC multiplexing, initialize/shutdown
coordination, and document state tracking. No merging yet.

### M2: Multi-server diagnostics (done)

Add a second server (eslint) for `.ts`/`.js` files. Merge diagnostics
from both via union. Fan out `didOpen`/`didChange`/`didClose` to both.
Route single-response methods (hover, definition) to primary server only.

### M3: Notification bridging + Volar 3

Implement the bridge config. Add vue-language-server v3 and wire
`tsserver/request` → vtsls. This replaces the Volar 2 plugin.

### M4: Full response merging

Extend merging to completions, hover, code actions. Handle deduplication,
timeout/fallback, and capability-aware routing.

## Tech Stack

- Node.js (same runtime as the servers it manages)
- `vscode-jsonrpc` for LSP message parsing
- `valibot` for config schema validation
- `picomatch` for glob pattern matching (file watcher exclusions)
- Distributed as a Claude Code LSP plugin (`.lsp.json` + `plugin.json`)
- Server-agnostic — works with any `.lsp.json`-compatible server

## Context from Prior Investigation

- Claude Code reads `command` from local `.lsp.json` cache but ignores `args`
  modifications — args come from the remote marketplace on startup
- The `.cmd` suffix patch for Windows npm shims IS read from local cache
- The `fix-lsp-support` tweakcc patch handles `.cmd` → executable resolution
- PSES (PowerShell) writes `PowerShellEditorServices.json` to cwd because the
  upstream plugin config lacks `-SessionDetailsPath` — unrelated to this project
  but relevant if PSES is included as a managed server
